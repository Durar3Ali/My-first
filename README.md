# My First Github project

This repository contains a simple **1-page HTML & CSS website** I built as my very first project on GitHub.

### Purpose

- To try out creating my first GitHub repository
- To set up VSCode with some extensions and settings
- To learn how to push code from local machine to GitHub

### Notes

This is my first try, so it’s just a basic webpage with some sections & placeholder images.
